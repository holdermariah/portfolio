					'Arpô Café is a Brazilian coffee shop inspired by the vibrant spirit and iconic landscapes of Rio de Janeiro. The brand name comes from "Pedra do Arpoador," a famous coastal landmark known for its breathtaking sunsets.\n\nFor the logo, I developed a visual identity that blends Brazilian energy with the cozy atmosphere of a neighborhood coffee shop. The color palette draws inspiration from Brazil\'s natural tones and sunny coastline, reinforcing the brand\'s roots and cultural essence.\n\nThe logo incorporates symbolic elements such as the sun, a coffee cup, a coffee bean, and the surrounding mountains. Together, these shapes represent both the richness of Brazilian coffee and the unique geography of Rio de Janeiro. The typography was carefully selected to convey a sense of movement, reflecting both the flow of coffee and the gentle rhythm of Rio\'s ocean waves. This detail brings harmony and motion to the visual identity, connecting the brand even more deeply to its cultural and geographic inspiration.\n\nThe result is a vibrant and meaningful mark that reflects the soul of Arpô Café: welcoming, authentic, and proudly Brazilian.',

					'Elali Counselling sought a brand identity that expressed warmth, emotional support, and a subtle connection to motherhood. The client envisioned floral elements and a gentle colour palette capable of evoking comfort and empathy.\n\nTo bring this concept to life, I designed a visual identity centered around softness and emotional clarity. The logo features a minimalist jasmine flower enclosed in an oval frame, symbolizing nurturing, protection, and personal growth. The final result is a harmonious and soothing brand identity that aligns with Elali Counselling\'s values: professional, compassionate, and deeply human.',
